Set up two int counters for wins, 
	how do I store wins and update them?
	what data type stores numbers?
	- enemy wins
	- my wins

when someone wins increase win counters (increment)



Game ends at 5 wins for either player or computer

game to stop at 5 wins
- two counters

if either win counters are 5 or higher
 if playerwins or computerwins equal to 5
	- restart game

we want to have the loss/win/draw shown on the screen and not just to the console 

add new counters for below: 
	-draws (completed)
	-total games 
		- would be like the click me action that everytime a starting decision function was ran the counter would go up
		by one 
		-set the varible counter 
		- set the anchor in html 
		- 



Add a text block of who won when they hit 5 wins
	-Add a start again button 

We want to call on 

add into show restart game function the winner of the rounds
